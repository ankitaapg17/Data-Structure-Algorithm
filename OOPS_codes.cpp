Virtual base class
//Consider the situation where we have one class A. This class A is inherited
//by two other classes B and C. Both these classes are inherited in a new class D.



//As can be seen from the figure that data members/ functions of class A are inherited twice to class D.
//One through class B and second through class C. When any data/ function members of class A is
//accessed by an object of class D, ambiguity arises as to which data/function members would be called?
//One inherited through B or the other inherited through C. This confuses compiler and it flashes error
//message. To resolve this ambiguity when class A is inherited in both class B and class C, it is declared
//as virtual base class by placing the keyword virtual as:



//Now only one copy of data/function member
//will be copied to class C and class B and class A becomes virtual base class. Virtual base classes offer
//a way to save space and avoid ambiguities in class hierarchies that uses multiple inheritances. When a
//base class is specified as a virtual base, it can act as an indirect base more than once without
//duplication of its data members. A single copy of its members is shared by all the base classes that use
//it as a virtual base.




//The class A has just one data member a which is public. This class is
//virtually inherited in class B and class C. Now class B and class C becomes virtual base
//class and no duplication of data member a is done. 


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class A

public:
void show()

cout << "Hello from A \n";

//Virtual Function: A virtual function is a function in a base class that is declared using the
//keyword virtual. Defining in a base class a virtual function, with another version in a derived class, it
//signals to the compiler that we don't want static linkage for this function. What we do want is the
//selection of the function to be called at any given point in the program to be based on the kind of
//object for which it is called. This sort of operation is referred to as dynamic linkage, or late binding.	
	
	
	
	
//Polymorphism:
//In C++, polymorphism causes a member function to behave differently based on
//the object that calls/invokes it. 
//It occurs when you have a hierarchy of classes related through inheritance. For example, suppose we
//have the function makeSound(). When a cat calls this function, it will produce the meow sound. When
//a cow invokes the same function, it will provide the moow sound	
	



//Compile Time Polymorphism: You invoke the overloaded functions by matching the number and
//type of arguments. The information is present during compile-time. This means the C++ compiler will
//select the right function at compile time. Compile-time polymorphism is achieved through function
//overloading and operator overloading

//Function Overloading: Function overloading occurs when we have many functions with similar
//names but different arguments. The arguments may differ in terms of number or type.



//Operator Overloading: In Operator Overloading, we define a new meaning for a C++ operator. It
//also changes how the operator works. For example, we can define the + operator to concatenate two
//strings. We know it as the addition operator for adding numerical values. After our definition, when
//placed between integers, it will add them. When placed between strings, it will concatenate them.


#include<iostream>

//Output: 13 + i9


//Runtime Polymorphism: This happens when an object's method is invoked/called during runtime
//rather than during compile time. Runtime polymorphism is achieved through function overriding. The
//function to be called/invoked is established during runtime.

//Function Overriding: Function overriding occurs when a function of the base class is given a new
//definition in a derived class. At that time, we can say the base function has been overridden.


//this pointer: 
//
//To understand this pointer, it is important to know how objects look at functions
//and data members of a class. a) Each object gets its own copy of the data member. b) All-access the same function definition as present in the code segment. Meaning each object gets its own copy of data members and all objects share a single copy of
//member functions. Then now question is that if only one copy of each member function exists and is used by multiple
//objects, how are the proper data members are accessed and updated? The compiler supplies an
//implicit pointer along with the names of the functions as this. The this pointer is passed as a
//hidden argument to all non-static member function calls and is available as a local variable within
//the body of all non-static functions.


//The this pointer holds the address of current object, in simple words you can say that
//this pointer points to the current object of the class. Here you can see that we have two data members
//num and ch. In member function setMyValues() we have two local variables having same name as
//data members name. In such case if you want to assign the local variable value to the data members
//then you wont be able to do until unless you use this pointer, because the compiler wont know that
//you are referring to objects data members unless you use this pointer. This is one of the example
//where you must use this pointer.







//A virtual function is another way of implementing run-time polymorphism in
