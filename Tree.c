//Binary tree- used to show hierarchial data e.g:- employees and their position in organisation
//It is a collection of entities called nodes linked together to simulate a hierarchy. Tree is a non-linear data structure. 
//The data can be of any type
//root,children,parent,sibling
//root is the only node without a parent
//Sibling- have same parent
//leaf- has no child
//Internal nodes- nodes that have atleast one children
//Tree- recursive data structure, root has its link to sub-trees: so it reduces something in self-similar manner
//nodes=N, edges=N-1

//Depth of node x= length of path from root to x OR no. of edges in path from root to x.
//Depth of root node=0

//Height of x= no. of edges in longest path from x to a leaf
//Height of leaf nodes=0
//Height of tree= height of root node


//Types of trees-
//Binary tree- a tree in which each node can have at most 2 children
//Common way of implementing tree- Dynamically created nodes linked using pointers


//Application of trees-
//1. Storing naturally hierarchial data. e.g:- file system
//2. Organize data for quick search, insertion, deletion e.g:- Binary Search Trees (O(logn))
//3. A special kind of tree called Trie is used to store dictionary, its really fast and efficient and is used for dynamic spell checking
//4. Also used in network routing algorithm


//Depending on what needs to be stored?
//Cost of operations
//Memory usage
//Ease of implementation
