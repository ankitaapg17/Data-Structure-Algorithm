//Sorting elements of an array by frequency (hashmap).
//Sort an array according to the order defined by another array
//Replace each element of the array by its rank in the array






//Using a hashing mechanism, we can store the elements (also first index) 
//and their counts in a hash. Finally, sort the hash elements according to their counts.
